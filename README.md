Async RPC client for Ethereum
-----------------------------

An experimental client for those who think that [`web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) grew too unwieldy, and also wants [`trio`](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) support.

**Warning:** probably not a good idea to use it on mainnet yet.
