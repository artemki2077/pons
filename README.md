Async RPC client for Ethereum
-----------------------------

[![pypi package][pypi-image]][pypi-link] ![License][pypi-license-image] [![Docs][rtd-image]][rtd-link] [![Coverage][cov-image]][cov-link]

An experimental client for those who think that [`web3`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) grew too unwieldy, and also wants [`trio`](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) support.

**Warning:** probably not a good idea to use it on mainnet yet.
